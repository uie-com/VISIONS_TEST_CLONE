                <br>
                <p>This Intensive is an online workshop unlike any other you’ve ever experienced. We call it an
                    Intensive because, well, it’s intense.

                </p>
                <br>

                <p>This Intensive is an advanced program for UX, product, and development practitioners who already
                    understand the basics
                    of user experience. It will push you into new territory, exploring concepts and approaches you’ve
                    likely never seen
                    before.
                    </b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Yet, once you hear Jared Spool break these new approaches into bite-sized concepts that are easy to
                    understand, you’ll
                    feel like these ideas make complete sense. That’s because they’re a natural next step to your lived
                    experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Every moment of every session presents new ideas and explores original ways to approach UX research
                    practice. Past
                    attendees have told us they feel like what they learned has revitalized their careers.</p>



                <h3>Your minimum commitment: 9 hours over six days.</h3>

                <p>The <b>Fundamentals of Strategic UX Visions</b> package consists of six
                    90-minute sessions, each led by Jared Spool. The <b>Prepare to Lead (PTL) a Strategic UX Vision</b>
                    package adds another 60-minute session plus three 90-minute sessions. Altogether, there are
                    fourteen-and-a-half
                    hours of mind-expanding material over the two weeks.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We hold each session twice: at 12pm (16.00 GMT) and 6pm (22.00 GMT). You can attend either session,
                    and Jared will be there to answer your questions.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Plus, each session’s recording is available the next day. That way, if you miss one, you can catch up
                    quickly.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>You’ll have questions. We’re ready for that. Each 90-minute session will give us plenty of time to
                    discuss how you’ll make all this work in your situation.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We’ll also ensure you have the confidence to do this right. We have created a dedicated private area
                    in our <i>Leaders of Awesomeness </i> community. Post your questions there so Jared and the
                    community can
                    share their thoughts. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Discuss the gnarliest of challenges, and you’ll come away with all the assurance you need that you’ve
                    got this.

                <br>
                <p>We offer two packages for this intensive to match where you are.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The 9-hour <b>Fundamentals of Strategic UX Visions</b> package is for emerging and existing UX
                    Leaders who
                    want a solid understanding of what goes into a Strategic UX Vision.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Jared Spool will introduce all the essential concepts behind Crafting and Leading a Strategic UX
                    Vision. You’ll discover how to establish the vision, build up the research, communicate the vision,
                    and get buy-in from stakeholders.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The attendance-limited, 14-hour <b>Prepare to Lead (PTL) a Strategic UX Vision </b> package is for UX
                    leaders ready to make this happen in their organizations. You’ll work directly with Jared Spool to
                    create a leadership plan to craft and roll out your strategic UX vision. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These additional sessions cover the implementation details needed to start your organization’s
                    transformation. We limit the attendance at the PTL sessions, so you’ll get more of Jared’s time to
                    address your particular challenges.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The PTL package also includes a pre-conference session, during which you’ll share your current
                    challenges with Jared. This way, he can tailor the sessions to your needs and supply you with extra
                    resources to give you additional insights into your transformation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Additionally, as a PTL member, you’ll meet with Jared for a private, 30-minute <b>1-on-1 Mentoring
                        Session</b>, to address any challenges you encounter once you’ve started applying what you’ve
                    learned.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Note: We won’t offer this Intensive publicly again before the end of 2025.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>If you think your organization will need to clarify and define its direction in the next year, you
                    don’t want to miss your opportunity to learn from Jared.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To join the Intensive, decide whether to take in just the fundamentals or the full PTL package.</p>

                <p>
                    Organizations and teams say they’re human-centered. Yet, you never hear them mention the actual
                    humans their work and projects are about. They fall back on generic labels, like “user” and
                    “applicant,” because nobody introduces them to real people who will benefit from a better-designed
                    product or service.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    UX outcomes can make your organization truly human-centered. They are a simple technique for making
                    daily work more delightful and valuable to the people who use it. The magic of a UX Outcome is that
                    it shows teams precisely how their work will improve the lives of real people.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>UX Outcomes will become the basis of our experience vision. They will serve as a measurable
                    destination for our teams as they execute the experience vision.
